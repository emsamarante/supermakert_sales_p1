# Supermarket Sales

## Description

In this project, I analyzed supermarket sales data from the United States and presented the results through this dashboard. To facilitate future updates to this project, I developed it using the MVC architecture. However, I am considering creating a new project to add additional functionalities instead of creating new versions of this one.

## Functionalities

I added a side menu where you can toggle the dark mode and included a brief description in the collapsed item. All graphs are updated with a single callback. The user can select the cities they want to include in the results and choose between the 'ratings' or 'gross margin' analysis. For the 'ratings' analysis, I applied the average, while for 'gross margin,' I calculated the sum.
